# Design an algorithm that is able to min/max comparison with
# (3n/2) - 2 comparisons.
# Can use list, python. Need to set a performance counter to
# count how many comparisons you do. So that at the end we can
# check if we are meeting our comparison goal of 3n/2 - 2.
#
# import random : imports a library that lets you use random numbers
# random.randrange(n): chooses "random" number from 0 to n.
# L = [random.randrange(100) for _ in range(100)]: creates array
# filled with integers from 0 to 100 scrambled in the array.
