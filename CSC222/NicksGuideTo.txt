HANDY DANDY TERMINAL GUIDE
=================================================================================================================
FOR FEDORA WEARING SCRUBLORDS.
 
TO START:
>> = COMMAND INPUTTING SOMETHING INTO SOMETHING ELSE. IE: ls >>> Penis.txt. Ls's results are put in the .txt, not the console.
<< = SOMETHING GOING INTO THE COMMAND. Not really sure what this one means, but it's something!
| = PIPING. SENDS OUTPUT FROM FIRST COMMAND AS INPUT FOR SECOND COMMAND. Ie: ls -la1 | grep 'Penis' PRINTS BIG ASS LIST AND SENDS IT TO GREP, A SEPERATE PROGRAM, WHICH THEN SEARCHES FOR 'Penis' IN LS'S
    >>>OUTPUT.
&& = 'AND'. DO TWO DIFFERENT, SEPERATE ACTIONS IN ONE COMMAND YOU CHEEKY SOD.
 
GROUPING OPTIONS: ls -la. l and a are 2 options. OR ls -l -a. Another example: cp -vn OR cp -v -n
WILDCARD: ULTRA POWERFUL, SO PAY ATTENTION.
    >>When it comes to moving, copying or whatever a whole bunch of files with the same name, use *. It basically means "And whatever else".
    >>Ie: I try to move some Assassin's Creed music into a AC folder:
    >> mv Assassins_Creed* ./ACFolder
    >>This will move anything starting with "Assassins_Creed" followed by "anything else"
    >>Can work backwards too: Wanna move mp3 files?
    >>mv *.mp3 ./ACFolder
    >>That moves "whatever else" .mp3 to the specified folder. It's valid so long as it ends in Mp3.
    >>You can do it for stuff in the middle as well.
    >>mv *Who_Knows* ./ACFolder
    >>That will ONLY move items with the characters "Who_Knows" SOMEWHERE amid the title. "Whatever Else"-"Who_Knows"-"Whatever Else"
    >>Finally, you can use it to adress everything in the whole directory
    >> rm *
    >>The following DELTES FUCKING EVERYTHING in the current directory, since everything files true for "Whatever Else".
 
>>>clear - cleans the terminal of all the BULLSHIT you did ya dick.
 
>>>cd - Change Directory. [NOT ONE FOLDER AT A TIME.If you need to go to home/penis/fuck/urmom, you can't do cd home, cd penis, cd fuck, cd urmom. You HAVE to use the ./ operator.
               QUICK RUNDOWN:
               ./ - MEANS "THIS DIRECTORY"
               ../ - MEANS "PREVIOUS DIRECTORY"
               Therefore and thusly, you'd need to do this: cd home, cd ./peni,. cd ./fuck, and then cd./urmom. Or, just do this: cd home/penis/fuck/urmom. You'll go stright there.]
 
>>>less - Reads .txt files all nice like. EX: less Janus.txt
 
>>>cat - Shittier version of less. EX: cat Janus.txt
 
>>>pico - Edits text documents all nice like. EX: pico Janus.txt. OR just pico. Opening pico lets you make text documents...in the directory you're currently in.
      BIG OL TIP: When you exit, you'll be prompted to save. Save as .cc if you're doing a C++ program.
 
>>>g++ - Compiles .cc files.
     OPTIONS:
     -o = "Output". Lets you specify a name for the .out file. EX: g++ -o FuckThisShitImOut BabbysFirstProgram.cc (Command, Options, Target. REMEMBER.)
     -std=c++11 = FORCE c++11. Necessary if you want to initialize a variable AND give it a value. Actually, fuck that, this is goddamn vital.
 
>>>vim - C++ writer.
     INSTRUCTIONS:
     To begin: INSERT and ENTER
     PRESS ESCAPE to enter command mode and INSERT to enter edit mode.
     IN EDIT MODE: Press INSERT again to type in replacement mode. It sucks.  Basically, don't hit INSERT while in edit mode.
     IN COMMAND MODE: Hit SHIFT+; (So, basically, type a colon. : <- This Thing.) to input a command.
     COMMANDS:
     :w - Saves the code. Type :w FILENAME.cc to specify a filename. IE: :w JanusOrgySimulator2020.cc.
     :x - Saves and Exits code.
     SAVING AS .CC WILL MAKE TEXT HAVE PWETTY COLORS. owo
 
>>>cp - Copy File. EX: cp Janus.txt JanusAgain.txt. cp FILE1 FILE2. File1 is copied with the name File2. If the name File2 already exists, ie I've already got a "JanusAgain.txt", then the old File2 is
    replaced with the new file 2.
    TIDBIT: You can specify WHERE the copy goes. cp FILE1 DIRECTORY. So, like this: cp Janus.txt home/penis/urmom. Then, the Janus copy will go to urmom.
    ANOTHER TIDBIT: You don't have to copy only files in the same directory. Fuck it, just do this: cp data/PMD/Janus.txt home/penis/urmom. COMMAND, PATH TO SOURCE, DESTINATION DIRECTORY.
    OPTIONS:
    -v = Details what the terminal is doing. Good if you're a FUCKING NERD.
    -n = The copying will not overwrite anything. Noice.
 
>>>ls - List everything. Lists directories, .exes, everything.
    OPTIONS:
    -l = Gives more details on everything
    -a = Shows hidden files.
 
>>>mv - Move a thing. IE: mv Janus.txt -t  home/penis/ComeEreJanusss. COMMAND, SOURCE, DESTINATION.
    OPTIONS (Sort of):
    -t = Destination. Kind of non-optional, actually. Sort of need this.
 
>>>rm - Remove a thing. IE rm JunkData.txt. Easy peasy.
    OPTIONS:
    -f = FORCE. Ignores weird stuff that would just waste your time and doesn't prompt. Just fucking, you know...does it.
    -v = VERBOSE. Explains everything that's going on.
 
>>>mkdir - Make Directory. IE mkdir ./PENIS. You have to specifcy where the directory is (Hence, the ./) so you can make a new directory anywhere FROM anywhere.
 
>>>rmdir - Remove Directory AND EVERYTHING IN IT. AHHAHAHAHAHAHAH *faps*. IE: rmdir ./LiterallyFuckThisDirectory
 
>>>sudo - Comes before command. SUPERUSER DO, giving extended permissions. IE: sudo ls /home/superdupersecretfiles/MEME_DATABASE
      REQUIRES PASSWORD.
 
>>>alsamixer - opens the alsamixer, a gui program for sound inputs and outputs
 
>>>pasuspender - Suspends PulseAudio for specific programs in case its acting like a cunt. IE: pasuspender mumble
 
>>>apt-get - Gets stuff from the main package. If it ain't in the main package, you'll need to nab it from online...not sure how to do that yet.
         OPTIONS (kind of not really)
         apt-get update = updates all the packages
 
>>>install - installs a package. Used in conjunction with apt-get, usally. IE apt-get install mumble. REQUIRES SUDO.
 
>>>man - sees the manual for...everything. No, really. EVERYTHING. IE: man mumble. man help. man man. man mkdir.
 
>>>help - not very helpful.
 
>>>xdg-open - Will open a file with its default program. ie: xdg-open JanusNoms.docx
 
>>>tar - Will unpack tar and bz2 files.
     FORMAT: tar -OPTIONS file.tar.bz2/gz -C /path/to/directory
     OPTIONS:
     x - extracts the files
     t - lists items inside of an archive
     -C - Change to directory. I USE IT AT THE END TO EXTRACT TO SPECIFIC DIRECTORIES. But I assume this can applied to other stuff to...
     f - use archive file or device ARCHIVE (whatever that means. Used in the xfj for tar.bz2 because MAGIC *snort snort*)
     j - deals with bzip2. Basically use this if you're doing stuff to a bz2 file.
     z - deals with gzip. Basically use THIS if you're doing stuff to a .gz file.
 
>>>dpkg - Opens a package (.deb) file.
      OPTIONS:
      -i = INSTALL. (Please to reccomend)
 
***RUNNING PROGRAMS***
 
Nine times out of ten, you can just...run it.
Like, for STEAM? Just type "Steam". Or just type "Mumble".
Gotta learn all the different execution names that terminal uses.
 
mumble - STARTS MUMBLE
 
pasuspend mumble - if you actually want to talk to people
 
steam - STEAM
 
chromium-browser - Why they added "browser", I have no idea. Opens chromium.
 
mplayer - The movie player. UNKNOWN FORMAT. LOOK INTO.
 
youtube-dl - Downloads Youtube videos.
        >>FORMAT
            youtube-dl [URL]
        >>FORMAT FOR MP3
            youtube-dl -x --audio-format mp3 [URL]
 
            >> -x = Extract Audio
            >> --audio-format [FORMAT]
                >>can do: mp3 mp4 oog, all that. Noice. Nifty
 
        >>NOTE: WILL DOWNLOAD TO HOME FOLDER.
 
audacity - Opens up audacity
        >>NOTE. PULSE AUDIO ACTS LIKE A BITCH AGAIN. Run with following command:
            env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 audacity &
        >>BE SURE NO OTHER PROGRAM IS USING PULSE AUDIO. This will, I guess, lock Pulse' latency so it won't make Audacity go haywire.
        >>MAKE SURE AUDACITY OUTPUT DEVICE IS SET TO: >>> HDA INTEL: ALC1200 Analog (hw: 0,0) <<<
        >>BECUASE THIS FIX NEEDS AND HW...WHATEVER THAT IS...
 
***SYSTEM PROGRAMMING***
^^^ FOR YOUR CLASS, DUMBASS ^^^
 
>>> grep - Lets you find text patterns in...anything. Pipe ( | ) another program's output into this in order to find just what you need.
        OPTIONS:
        -e = Basically says "Also try and find this". So, usage: grep -e 'This' -e 'Also that
        NOTE: Put things you want to find in quotes. This program is better used in tandem with other program's output...or txt files in you're a FUCKING NERD.
 
>>> ps - displays current processes.
 
>>> jobs - Active and suspended programs are printed.
 
>>> chmod - changes permissions for a file. Best used with ls -l...because that displays a file with its permissions.
        USAGE:
        chmod [group][Add or Remove][Permission Type] [File in Question]
       
        Permissions are broken up into 3 groups: Users, Leader Groups, Others. Using ls -l, you can see the format:
 
            rwxrwxrwx
            In which:
           
            rwx rwx rwx
            ^^^ ^^^ ^^^
            User    Group   Others
           
            There's also one other value before these 9, but who gives a fuck about it. (For now...)
 
        These letters are either on or off, like here: Writing is turned off for User but not Group (Haphazard, but shut up, it's an example.)
 
            r-xrwxrwx
 
        Here's what it'll probably look more like:
 
            rwxr--r--
       
        Where everyone else can only read. Only the USER may execute and write!
 
            >>>GROUPS: [This addresses which of the three parts of the permission values we're dealing with when changing permissions]
                u = 'User'. That means you, dumbass.
                g = 'Leader Group'. I guess that means other users on the computer.
                o = 'Others'.
                a = 'All'. Changes the value for everyone.
 
            >>>Add or Remove:
                + = Turns on the Permission
                - = Turns off the Permission.
           
            >>>Permission Type: [What Permission are we messing with?]
                r = Read. I can see what's on it.
                w = Write. I can change it.
                x = Executable. I can activate it...which is required to read most of the time. Hey, it's a relic, cut it a break.
 
        Example format:
 
        chmod g-r JanusPornStory.txt
       
        This makes it to where the Leader Group can't read my super secret Janus smut. Thank god.
