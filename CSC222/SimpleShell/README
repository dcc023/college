Simple Shell by Dylan Campbell

For those who are curious how this Simple Shell works
------------------------------------------------

How-To
======
All of the builtin commands we got here are cd, pwd(not functioning properly), exit, and info.

We've also ripped off all the non-builtins, so you can use this like the normal shell. "cat file.txt" etc.

Every attempt of redirection was a failure, so to have this program even functional, we had to cut it.
